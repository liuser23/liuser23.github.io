# Overview

This is my development portfolio built from a starting template provided by Jacobo Martinez - https://github.com/cobiwave/.

I made changes to update and personalize the template in ways I thought might be interesting adding CSS effects, a skills section, and different navigation options to the original page. I also made an effort to keep the design responsive while updating content, particularly the skills section. This was a fun project and my first exposure to SASS, SCSS, and Bootstrap for styling, and I learned how valuable a well-organized project structure is, particularly when another developer has to come in and make updates!
